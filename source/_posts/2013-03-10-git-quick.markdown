##Intro
I have prepared some small projects I need to share and to use for this blog and I have had to load them on `GitHub`. Well I am pretty new to it and I would like to have an easy and quick (for the time being) guide to pull my code to the repository.

##Git Jargon
Some reserved words in the `Git` galaxy.

* __Repository.__ It can be local or remote according to how the version control system has been defined.
	* __origin__ is the remote repository
	* __master__ is the initial local repository

##Configuring Git
The configuration has the main goal to be recognized by `GitHub` when files are pulled from the local repository (master) to the remote one (the origin).
To do this:

* Create and `SSH-key`
* Provide the `SSH-key` to `Git`
* Introduce yourself to `Git`

For these steps just follow the excellent guide provided by `GitHub` [[3]]

If you get the error `Permission denied (publickey).` running `git push origin master` please check [[4]].


##Add Stuff to GitHub
Here step by step what I have done

1. Create a repository on `GitHub`
2. Select on `Github` the `SSH` access to the repository and see
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
git@github.com:blackat/springfoos.git
{% endcodeblock %}
3. Instance Git inside the local repository
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git init
{% endcodeblock %}
4. Add all the files to the current stage
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git add .
{% endcodeblock %}
5. Check the status of the current stage verifying that all the files will be added during the commit
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git status
{% endcodeblock %}
6. Commit the current stage to your local repository
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git commit -m 'First commit of the project'
{% endcodeblock %}
7. Connect your local repository to the remote one
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git remote add origin git@github.com:blackat/springfoos.git
{% endcodeblock %}
8. Check that the remote repository has been added in `./.git/config` file
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
[remote "origin"]
	url = git@github.com:blackat/springfoos.git
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
{% endcodeblock %}
9. If ready to push commits to the remote repository, the origin, run
{% codeblock lang:bat %}
MacBook:springfoos blackcat$ git push origin master
{% endcodeblock %}
