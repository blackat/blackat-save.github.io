I have read different blog posts and I have had a look at different projects on Github in order to improve my way of scaffolding an AngularJS project and better implement the MVC pattern, above all the separation of concerns between the controller and the services.

As reference points I am using the following blogs

  - (Todd Motto)[http://toddmotto.com/]
  - (John Papa angular-styleguide)[https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide]
  - (Minko Gechev)[https://github.com/mgechev/angularjs-style-guide#naming-conventions]
